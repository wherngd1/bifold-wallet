# Changesets

If your PR should result in a version bump, please add a changeset by running `yarn changeset add` from the root of the repo, after you've committed your changes

This folder has been generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can find the full documentation for it [in their repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)
